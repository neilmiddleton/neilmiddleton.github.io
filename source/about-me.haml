      I'm an engineer at
      %a{:href => "http://www.heroku.com", :target => "_blank"} Heroku
      based in the UK.

    %p
      I've been a long time fan of using the Heroku platform and have contributed
      a fair amount to the Heroku community over the last few years.  I've also
      spent the last few months writing the upcoming 'Heroku' for O'Reilly.

    %p
      When I'm not near a computer I can be found pounding the hell out of a
      drumkit somewhere, putting some sort of model together, or trying to
      keep the kids in check.

        Whilst I work for Heroku, all of the content on this site represents my (probably correct) opinion, and not necessarily that of Heroku.
