      There are a number of things at play in the development of this site.  A lot
      of cogs that are constantly in motion to try and bring this page you see to
      your desktop right now.  Therefore, I thought I would talk about how this site
      is put together, both from a personal and technical point of view, as well as
      some other interesting information.

    %h2 Writing and Technical

    :markdown
      All the writing I do is done inside [IA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com), and in
      markdown.  This content is then published via the very good
      [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), with a sprinkling of
      [Middleman-blog](https://github.com/middleman/middleman-blog).

      You can review the code that makes up this site
      [here on Github](https://github.com/neilmiddleton/neilmiddleton_com).

      This site is hosted completely on Heroku using a variety of buildpacks.
      Firstly the [Middleman Buildpack](https://github.com/meskyanichi/heroku-buildpack-middleman)
      to generate the website in it's static form, then the
      [NginX buildpack](https://github.com/essh/heroku-buildpack-nginx) so that I
      can host these static files behind a neat web server thus negating the need
      for a ruby process.  In order to acheive this I also had to use the [Multi
      Buildpack](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi).  For more
      information, please read about the [composability of buildpacks](/the-composability-of-buildpacks/).

      DNS is provided by [DNSimple](http://www.dnsimple.com), mainly beacuse they
      offer [the ALIAS record](/the-dangers-of-a-records-and-heroku/).

    %h2 Design

    :markdown
      The design is custom, and only just works, but it works.  Fonts are provided by
      [Typekit](http://typekit.com), using '[Museo Sans](https://typekit.com/fonts/museo-sans)'
      for the main copy, and Adobe's '[Source Code Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/source-code-pro)' for the code samples.

      Analytics are provided by Google.

    %h2 Contributions
