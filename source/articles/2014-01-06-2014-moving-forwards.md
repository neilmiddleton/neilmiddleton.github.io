title: 2014 - moving forwards
---

I'm not normally one for writing articles about things such as new years, but I figured I'd do something this year just to be a bit different.  These aren't necessarily resolutions or any other such bollocks, but more of a series of self-promises that I've decided to make to myself over the winter break.  Take them as you will.

## Do something different

For years, I've been a single tool developer - always focusing on one particular programming language and doing everything with that one tool.  Whilst I've certainly been exposing myself to numerous other tools over the years, these have never been more than via fleeting glimpses into another world. Whilst this has probably helped me over the years with gaining insight into how other people do things, I've never found myself actively using these tools much.  As such I've always kept on doing things in my default tool of choice, that currently being [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

Therefore, from now on, I'm going to try and get more to grips with another tool, and try to use it day to day much more.

In this instance, I'm looking at [Python](http://www.python.org).  Python has many things that appeals - it's fairly Ruby-esque in many ways, but very different in others.  It has a very appealing menifesto via the [zen of python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), and largely makes a lot of sense.  Additionally, I have access to [certain](http://kennethreitz.org) [coworkers](http://jacobian.org) who can help me when I get stuck.  It's not a hard thing to pick up, so I might as well make use of it.

## Do less

Another thing that I've been meaning to start doing more recently is working less.  Whilst working in a timezone +8 hours from the rest of your co-workers, it's tempting to let the days drag into the evenings, and you find yourself working more than you ordinarily would.  As a remote worker hours are something you need to keep an eye on and ensure that you're not overcooking what you intended to do from the outset.  I'm a sucker for just working until I get sleepy, so this is something that'll change - making more time for other things.

More hours worked != more things achieved.

In addition to this, I'm going to think of new ways to spice up what I do day to day.  Either change up the way that I currently work, or add new things to my domain that might take me in new directions in the future.  (N.B [Heroku](https://heroku.com) is an excellent employer for this)

## It's not all work

Which is where we start to think about things that aren't work related.  When working in a job you love it's tempting to let it take over everything you do and define you.  This year I'll be working to bring in some other significant pastime beyond family, work, and [endless physio](/growing-a-leg/) into my life.  I've some ideas on what this might comprise of, so maybe stay tuned for any news.

## In Summary

So, in short the goals I have are this

* Work with new tools doing new things
* Work a more reasonable amount
* Do something new outside of work, and completely different to work.
