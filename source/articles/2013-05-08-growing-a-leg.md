A while ago I was an avid motorbike rider.  I first rode when I was 16 as it was my only available means of transport and carried on for a few years.  Around three years ago though I decided that I would start to commute via bike and use it as my sole means of transport.

The benefits were obvious.  Parking was not a problem, fuel costs were lower and the time it took to get to work in the morning was halved.  What's more it was fun.  Riding a bike is a fun experience that keeps you alert and aware of the world around you.  

There are obviously some downsides though.  The main one is the weather.  When you're using a bike as your commuting tool you find yourself riding all year round.  In the UK this quite often means rain, and more rain, and for a chunk of the year riding in temperatures approaching zero.  However, for a few months of the year it was the complete opposite.  As anyone that has ridden a bike will know, riding in warm sunny weather is a joy.  Put it this way, I don't think I've ever taken the long way home from work in a car.

There is another downside, and that's the average mental deficiency of other people on the road in the UK.  I witnessed some amazingly bad driving.  When you're on a bike you have a different perspective of what is going on and being able to see into other cars makes you very aware of all the sorts of things that people get up to while driving.

Nine months ago that all changed.

The day before my brothers wedding I was riding home from my parents house. It was dark, around 11pm, and the roads were clear.  All was fine until I had a car pull out into my path as I was approaching at around 60mph.  I had no time to react.  I had no time to brake and I had no time to go elsewhere.  I hit the car almost broadside at 60mph.  At this point a few things happened.  Firstly, my bike disappeared, I flew through the air  around 10 metres and ended up around lying around 60 metres down the road in the central reservation (which was luckily grass), and the car I hit drove off.

There's me, lying in the middle of the road, in the dark, wondering where my bike had gone and where the bugger who'd hit me had run off to.  It was silent again and my left leg was numb.

After a few minutes I decided I should tell the wife I'd be late home and then got in touch with the ambulance service.  Luckily my phone had survived the crash and was still fully functional.  I sat on the phone for around ten minutes talking to the paramedics until a police car finally arrived trying to find me.  It was the first car/person I'd seen since the accident.

A short time later I was in hospital and getting seen to.

After a very hasty short while, some X-Rays and an CT Scan it was found I had smashed my hip up into about eight pieces and had slightly dislocated a shoulder. This meant surgery.

By now it was now Friday afternoon, I went into surgery and had a intermedullary nail fitted.  In short this is a titanium bar the length of your thigh, inserted into the middle of the broken bone in question and fixed at each end, with with more bars, or screws.  I was now bionic.

The next two weeks are hazy.  I was on a ton of drugs, in a fair wedge of discomfort, with a thigh twice the size of the other, and surrounded by senile old men who generally thought they were on a train.  I was having to deal with blood transfusions, basic physiotherapy to keep the joints moving, and no Wifi.  Times were hard.

After these two weeks though I was sent home and spent the next three months essentially sat in a reclining chair that we'd borrowed.  By this point the muscle atrophy had meant that I couldn't bend my leg at the knee and the lack of strength meant that doing anything involving moving around on crutches was nigh on impossible.  By the end of that first three months I was mobile, to a point, and able to at least move my leg a little.  I was still not allowed to use my leg at all (no weight whatsoever), so it was all essentially a waiting game.

After four months, I was told that weight bearing was now an option and I could start to use my leg.  At first this meant nothing more than stepping the leg in a walking motion, slowly working up to putting a small amount of weight through it.  Eventually, by the time Christmas came I was weight bearing and starting Hydrotherapy.

For those of you that don't know, Hydro is essentially physio but in a chest deep pool.  This is designed to allow you to carry out standing physio therapy with resistance on your movements, but without having to bear the weight of your body.  After a number of weeks of this, the basic movement of what was formerly known as my leg came back to where it was.

By now, we were in February, I was severely fucked off with not being able to walk, but at least now I was able to bear weight.

At this point small things start of piss you off.  For instance, in the UK you can apply for a disabled parking permit, however, these are on a permanent basis and only something that you can have if permanently disabled.  This means if you have a slightly gammy eye you can get a disabled badge and park right outside your local supermarket.  However, if you have an injury like mine where at some points making it 100m is  hard work, you can't and you have to walk past all the empty disabled bays and suffer.

These days things are starting to come back to normal.  I am now off crutches and onto just a walking stick (or cane if you're American).  I'm doing regular work at the gym on the muscle groups that have degraded, and I'm starting to get back to something that resembles normal walking.

Three months from now things should be back to normal to some extent.  The stick should be gone and most of the muscle issues should be resolved.  Hopefully all will be back to almost normal - almost a year on from the accident.

â€¦then I can go find another bike.
