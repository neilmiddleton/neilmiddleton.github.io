title: We need more conferences aimed at beginners

Over the last month I've had the privilege of attending two very different events.  The first was [BaRuCo](http://www.baruco.org/) in Barcelona, Spain, and the second was [RailsGirls London](http://railsgirls.co.uk/london/events/3).

These two different events were poles apart.  One was hosting hundreds of Ruby developers from all backgrounds.  The content was wide and deep and at some points pretty damn advanced (walking through the C code of Ruby anyone?).

RailsGirls on the other hand was the complete opposite.  We had around 80 girls who were completely new to development and barely knew their way around a laptop, let alone Ruby.

Whilst coaching the RailsGirls I realised that we as a community aren't helping ourselves.  We are constantly bombarded by a torrent of articles, blog posts and so on that are aimed at the seasoned Ruby developer and improving their extensive knowledge of working with Ruby. However, for the girls that have just walked out their RailsGirls workshop, this can be intimidating.

I would guess that if one of the girls attended something like BaRuCo, a serious case of [conscious incompetence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence) would kick in.  There is nothing worse than trying to learn something, having the enthusiasm, and then being battered back by a blast of information which you just don't understand, but be made to feel like you should.  If anything might put someone off learning more, than can.

The problem I see is that plenty of our User Groups, and Conferences aim to impress.  They tend to err on the side of advanced topics that experienced developers would get benefit from.  Plenty of user groups for instance suffer from speakers who are out to impress, out to demonstrate that they know more than the next developer, and are working with tools you just haven't heard of.  This aim to impress has led us down a path where we just don't cover the basics anymore.

There's plenty of content we need to learn to get started as a developer.  First, there is the basics, but there's also all the tips and tricks that we all need to pick up over years of practise.  In my opinion, conferences and user groups should provide some of this.  

Speakers should be able to stand on stage and not have to impress people with their super-advanced knowledge, but be able to feel that they can express the simpler stuff, without the feeling that half the audience will set on them for boring them with the 'basics' (I have seen people actively _complain_ before about speakers covering the basics before.  This is not on.).  

Basically, these events should consider themselves as able to cater for those fresh out of code school, be it an early education program such as RailsGirls, or even some sort of simple internship.  Events should consider scoring their talks/sessions to see if they are catering for the beginner and reviewing the overall level of pre-knowledge that someone might need to benefit from the event.  Conferences, after all, are meant as an educational event.

In essence, if we're all talking about the advanced new thing, how can the beginners ever catch up?  

Where are the conferences / user groups catering for the beginner?
