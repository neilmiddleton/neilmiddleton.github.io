Finally, after 18 months, ‚ÄúHeroku - Up and Running‚Äù is [available from O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027409.do).

Now - this isn't a thick book.  This book is an introduction designed to get you up and running, as the title suggests.

Over the years, I've bought many many tech books, and I am pretty sure that to this day I still haven't read a single one of them cover to cover.  I'm the sort of person who will read the first few chapters with enthusiasm, and then put it down never to return to it again.

Therefore, when we set out to make this book I wanted something that you could sit down with and read cover to cover in less than three or four hours.  I wanted a book that would introduce you to all the main parts of Heroku, and give you just enough knowledge so that you would be aware of the possibilities and how the various moving parts bolted together.  By having this knowledge you're empowered to figure things out, understanding how it all works, and able to know what to look for when you need to know more about a certain topic.

What's more, it's less of a book, and therefore, a much lower price.

I'm hoping that we can iterate on this format as things change and as new features arrive on Heroku, as well as touching on the new Heroku / Salesforce integrations mentioned [at this years Dreamforce](http://www.heroku.com/1).

The book is available on Kindle, Paperback, and everything in between.
